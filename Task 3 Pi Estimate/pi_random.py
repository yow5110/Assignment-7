# Week 9 Task 3
# This code draws n_total points in a square of side two centered in the origin of the cartesian plane.
# For each point, we check if it falls within the unit circle.
# From the ratio between the number of points within the unit circle n_in and the total number of points n_total we can estimate 

#starter code
import numpy as np

# the uniform() function generates n random numbers in the interval (low,high)
np.random.uniform(low, high, n)
