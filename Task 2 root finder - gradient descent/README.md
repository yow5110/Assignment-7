# Week 9 Task 2
In some of the previous examples we have been searching for the equilibrium distance of two atoms interacting with the Lennard-Jones potential. To find the minimum of the potential, we have searched for a value where the derivative of the potential is equal to zero.
To find the minimum of a function we could also adopt an alternative algorithm.
1. We choose an initial guess of the value of the minimum, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x_0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_0" title="x_0" /></a>.
2. We evaluate the derivative of the function at the current point. If the derivative is positive, i.e. the function is growing, it means that points to the left will be closer to the minimum. If the derivative is negative, it means that points to the right will be closer to the minimum. Thus, we take a step in the direction opposite and proportional to the derivative: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x_{n&plus;1}=x_{n}&space;-&space;t&space;\:&space;f'(x_n)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_{n&plus;1}=x_{n}&space;-&space;t&space;\:&space;f'(x_n)" title="x_{n+1}=x_{n} - t \: f'(x_n)" /></a>. The parameter t represents the size of the step and can be chosen to improve the speed and stability of the algorithm.
3. We repeat the process. As we approach the minimum, the derivative gets closer to zero and the change in our estimate becomes smaller and smaller.

TASK1: Implement a function that takes the function derivative <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=f'(x)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f'(x)" title="f'(x)" /></a> and an initial guess <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x_0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_0" title="x_0" /></a> in input and returns an estimate of the minimum. 

TASK2: Use this function to estimate the equilibrium distance of the pair of LJ atoms. Pay attention to the fact that the LJ force has the opposite sign with respect to the derivative of the potential (i.e. the gradient descent algorithm corresponds to moving downhill in the potential energy, following the direction of the force). Compare the accuracy of this algorithm with the bisection method in Assignment 1, how many steps are required to get to a given error in the result? How does the convergence change depending on the value of the parameter t? NOTE: you should konw the analytic value of the equilibrium distance, which you can use to compute the error in the numerical solutions.

EXPECTED OUTCOME: The results should converge to the analytic equilibrium distance, that you can compute by imposing that the analytic expression of the force is equal to zero.
